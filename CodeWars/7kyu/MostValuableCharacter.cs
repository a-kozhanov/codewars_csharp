Most valuable character

In this Kata, you will be given a string and your task is to return the most valuable character. 
The value of a character is the difference between the index of its last occurrence and the index of its first occurrence. 
Return the character that has the highest value. If there is a tie, return the alphabetically lowest character. 
[For Golang return rune]

All inputs will be lower case.

For example:
solve('a') = 'a'
solve('ab') = 'a'. Last occurrence is equal to first occurrence of each character. Return lexicographically lowest.
solve("axyzxyz") = 'x'
More examples in test cases. Good luck!
