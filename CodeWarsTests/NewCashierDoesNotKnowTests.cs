//New Cashier Does Not Know About Space or Shift
//Some new cashiers started to work at your restaurant.
//They are good at taking orders, but they don't know how to capitalize words, or use a space bar!
//All the orders they create look something like this:
//"milkshakepizzachickenfriescokeburgerpizzasandwichmilkshakepizza"
//The kitchen staff are threatening to quit, because of how difficult it is to read the orders.
//Their preference is to get the orders as a nice clean string with spaces and capitals like so:
//"Burger Fries Chicken Pizza Pizza Pizza Sandwich Milkshake Milkshake Coke"
//The kitchen staff expect the items to be in the same order as they appear in the menu.
//The menu items are fairly simple, there is no overlap in the names of the items:

//1. Burger
//2. Fries
//3. Chicken
//4. Pizza
//5. Sandwich
//6. Onionrings
//7. Milkshake
//8. Coke
